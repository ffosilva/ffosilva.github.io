title: "Secure and Privacy-Aware Data Dissemination for Cloud-Based Applications"
collection: publications
permalink: /publication/ucc-2017
excerpt: 'In this paper we propose a data dissemination platform that supports data security and different privacy levels even when the platform and the data are hosted by untrusted infrastructures. The proposed system aims at enabling an application ecosystem that uses off-the-shelf trusted platforms (in this case, Intel SGX), so that users may allow or disallow third parties to access the live data stream with a specific sensitivity-level. Moreover, this approach does not require users to manage the encryption keys directly. Our experiments show that such an approach is indeed practical for medium scale systems, where participants disseminate small volumes of data at a time, such as in smart grids and IoT environments.'
