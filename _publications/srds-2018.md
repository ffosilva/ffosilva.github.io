This paper presents PubSubSGX, a content-based publish-subscribe system that exploits trusted execution environments (TEEs), such as Intel SGX, to guarantee confidentiality and integrity of data as well as anonymity and privacy of publishers and subscribers.

We describe the technical details of our Python implementation, as well as the required system support introduced to deploy our system in a container-based runtime. Our evaluation results show that our approach is sound, while at the same time highlighting the performance and scalability trade-offs. In particular, by supporting just-in-time compilation inside of TEEs, Python programs inside of TEEs are in general faster than when executed natively using standard CPython.
