About me
======
My first code I wrote when I was only 4~5 (~ 28 years ago) on a Prologica CP-500 (the Brazilian version of TRS-80 Model III) using BASIC language. The code was simple, something like:

```
10 CLS
20 PRINT "Fabio"
30 GOTO 20
```

And 28 years after this fact I still remember exactly what I wrote because it was fantastic seeing my name on the entire screen (in the black n’ green terminal).

The time was passing and the things becoming interesting! dBase x Clipper and the first contact with databases & indexing, VB x Delphi and start understanding OO paradigm (and creating GUIs), Windows or Linux and... WOW! I remember but without any longing the ‘compile by yourself’ era!								
In the meanwhile, I already tried to be a physicist by joining the Physics course at the university – my father was an electromagnetism teacher - bad influence! OK, it was a good influence but physics has not made me complete. During the physics course, I always tried to embed a computer flavor in the experimental apparatus - uniform rectilinear motion, uniformly varied rectilinear motion, pendulum... computers are my passion!

And here I am! A Software Engineer passionately curious. With a technical degree in Information Technology from the Infogenius Technical College and a BS in Computer Science from the Federal University of Campina Grande, I have worked in several teams, often multidisciplinary, and learned about different technologies and to be a better human being. At the opensource, I have contributed to communities such CyanogenMod project (as device maintainer), Sony Open Device Program and also pushed commits to several FOSS projects. Currently, I’m researching and developing solutions on security aspects of cloud computing as part of R&D projects with the academy and industry for the last 3 years.
